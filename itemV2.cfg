description = "Updated for Season 3.
               - Includes support for the Bretonnian Longsword and the Breton Sword and Shield
               - Damage numbers are now based on the Hero Power and property/talent values of the character you are currently playing as. This means you will need to change characters when viewing their weapons in order to see the most accurate data. This will be fixed in a future update.
               - Ranged damage data is inaccurate. This will be fixed in a future update.
